# V-Model Loop Work-List

This file is the live control surface for the development loop and belongs in the main repository being changed. Every active user requirement, epic, acceptance scenario, system requirement, and task/slice must be traceable here.

Detailed epic contents live in the main repository's `epics/`. Epics may be single files or folders with a main epic file and task files. This file is the cross-epic index, completion rollup, and oversight surface for any task work delegated to subagents.

Both loops use TDD:

- Upper loop: write failing BDD/E2E/user-flow acceptance tests before the scenario is complete.
- Lower loop: write failing unit/component/API/contract/integration tests before implementation.

## Status Vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PROPOSED` | Identified but not ready for development |
| `READY` | Trace links and acceptance expectations are clear |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | Lower-loop implementation or upper-loop validation is underway |
| `LOWER_VERIFIED` | Red-first lower-loop tests pass for the linked task/system requirement |
| `UPPER_VALIDATED` | Red-first upper-loop BDD/E2E evidence passes for the linked scenario |
| `DONE` | Upper and lower evidence are complete, rolled up, and human-approved |
| `BLOCKED` | Cannot proceed; blocker must be recorded |
| `DEFERRED` | Consciously postponed; reason must be recorded |

## Epic Rollup

## Completion Roll-Up Rules

- A task is `LOWER_VERIFIED` when its red-first lower-loop tests pass and code references are linked.
- A system requirement is `LOWER_VERIFIED` when all linked tasks are lower-verified and code/test references are linked.
- An acceptance scenario is `UPPER_VALIDATED` when its red-first BDD/E2E/user-flow evidence passes and code references are linked.
- An epic is `DONE` when all linked scenarios are upper-validated, all linked system requirements are lower-verified, and human approval is recorded.
- A user requirement is `VALIDATED` when all linked epics are done and human approval is recorded.
- A work-list row is `DONE` only when the linked task is `LOWER_VERIFIED`, the linked acceptance scenario is `UPPER_VALIDATED`, no unrecorded gap remains, and the parent epic has human approval before epic-level `DONE`.

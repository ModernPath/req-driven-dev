name: rdd-completion-review
description: Audit, deliver, reconcile, and complete an IN_REVIEW requirement or epic scope. Use after implementation evidence is complete to verify the applicable delivered trace, integrate through the project's authorized path, open the human completion gate only after non-human prerequisites pass, and apply an attributable acceptance answer.

# Review and complete delivered work

Read the project `AGENTS.md`, canonical `PROCESS.md`, every entity explicitly in
scope, current code/tests/change, gate records, authoritative records, and
derived views.

## Procedure

1. Treat completion as unproven. Audit every scoped requirement clause,
   acceptance scenario, declared relation, gate, evidence result, and
   completion condition against direct current sources.
2. Stop for any `DERIVED` dependency, candidate link counted as authoritative,
   stale or inherited-unverified evidence, missing RED observation, material
   cold-review finding, undisclosed gap, or incomplete reconciliation.
3. If the pre-delivery audit passes, deliver through the project's authorized
   integration path while keeping awaiting entities `IN_REVIEW`.
4. Re-run or confirm evidence against the delivered revision and reconcile all
   authoritative records and derived views.
5. Record completion trace `PASS` only for the exact eligible fingerprint. Only
   then make the scoped human completion gate `OPEN` and present its brief.
6. Do not answer the gate for the human. If the authorized human answers,
   record the real actor, role, exact scope, answer, and `USER:` source.
7. Apply `DONE` only to accepted named entities that independently satisfy the
   complete applicable predicate. Apply member requirements before a named
   epic. Route rejection or requested changes through `rdd-triage` to the
   earliest invalidated phase.

## Report

Report proven, contradicted, incomplete, indirect, and missing completion
facts; delivered revision; reconciliation result; gate states; applied
transitions; and remaining work.
